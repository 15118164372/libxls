libxls - Read XLS files from C
==

Originally written in 2002 by Komarov Valery, libxls has everything you need to
pull data out of old-fashioned binary Excel files. This repository will soon
house the "official" fork of libxls, passed down from Valery by way of 
Christophe Leitienne and David Hoerl.
